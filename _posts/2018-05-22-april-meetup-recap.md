We had a great meetup at [Trusource Labs](https://www.trusourcelabs.com/)! Thanks again to Ben Nemeth of [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) for his talk about the recent developments Cisco has released to increase native support for Apple devices. Shout out to Mike Donovan for his demo of [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com)! And special thanks to [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com) and Heather Adel for providing Tacos!

Below are the assets from the meetup, including the main deck and a recording of the Facebook Live video.

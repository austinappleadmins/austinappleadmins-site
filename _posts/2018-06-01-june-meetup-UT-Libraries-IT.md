We’re pleased to announce our next meetup is on June 20, 2018, at the [University of Texas, Perry Castañeda Library](https://lib.utexas.edu/study-spaces-technology/spaces/learning-lab-1-ab)! Todd Stabelfeldt, from the 2017 WWDC Acessibility keynote, will illustrate how Apple makes a profound impact, empowering people through integrated universal design and accessibility.
